ctagsparse
======================================================

> âš¡ Use [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) with lightning-fast tags parsing!

Rationale
---------

This project is inspired of [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim). As good as `fzf.vim` repository's functions are, they are too slow when searching tags from a big tag file. Peoples of bad faith would blame the Perl script working underneath but we are no such people. However, we still need an efficient way to format our tags for fzf.

Originally, this is designed for me to search in Linux kernel tags, which
contains approximately 5 millions tags (the tag file is almost 1GB).

Installation
------------

As for [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim), the [main fzf repository](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is required. Also you need to build `ctagsparse` to make it available to the plugin, the following will do everything needed:

```
Plug 'naccyde/ctagsparse', { 'do': 'make' }
```

How does it works?
------------------

The path to the tag files must be stored in vim's `tags` variable, so ctagsparse can find it. Then, call `:CTagsParse` to interactively search for a tag, or `:CTagsParseHere` to search for the tag under the cursor!

fzf is used to display a list of tags from which you can interactively select the one you want

The tag files used must be generated by `ctags` or another tools creating `ctags` compliant tag files.

Options
---------------

### `ctagsparse_exclude`

Exclude one or more path from the returned tags. Any tag found in a file which path is excluded won't be diplayed. This can speed up the parsing process if needed.

Excluded paths can be relative or absolute. Relative path are relative to vim's current working directory.

```
let g:ctagsparse_exclude = [ '/home/john/linux/drivers', 'net' ]
```

### `ctagsparse_allow`

By default, all paths are allowed. But you might need to exclude a path while allowed specific directories inside this excluded path, that's what this option is for.

Allowed paths can be relative or absolute. Relative path are relative to vim's current working directory.

```
let g:ctagsparse_allow = [ 'drivers/staging/axis_fifo' ]
```
